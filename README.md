# Generating and Iterating Complex Networks - complexNet
***
## Getting started
complexNet provides functions to easily generate and iterate complex networks. These networks rely on socially inherited and random connections to members of a population, as presented by [Ilany &amp; Akcay (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12084). Their modelling framwork has been shown to generate realistic networks with a wide range of different clustering, density, and average path length. In [Smolla &amp; Akcay (2019)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaaw0609) we have used the same algorithms to generate networks and have them dynamically evolve. 

My goal with this package is to provide an easy way to generate complex networks that rely on
